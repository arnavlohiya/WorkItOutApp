## WorkItOut App

### What It Is

WorkItOut **motivates** people to stick to their workout routines. It does so as follows:

1. The app prompts the user to enter an amount of money of their choice into our app.
2. The user sets their workout goals and also the timeframe over which they want to achieve these goals.
3. The money allocated by the user is converted to points in our application's backend. Every user starts at 0 points.
4. Every-time the user completes a workout session, they get a proportional fraction of their total points. These points can be used by the user to redeem an equivalent portion of the money they initially put into the app.
5. The user's money is returned in full when the user successfully completes their workout goals.
